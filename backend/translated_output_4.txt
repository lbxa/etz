--- Chunk 1 ---
Dear George and Ziva.
Today is a holiday.
And we are sitting together
with the mother
and expect from you
a telegram, at least,
which has already been born
with the help of the Lord God.
But so far we have nothing at all.
We are thinking,
we don't sleep
the whole night, not just one night, but we don't sleep at all.
Not the mother and not me.
But
we hope to the Lord God
that everything will go well
and you will be a healthy father
and she was a healthy mother.
The mother is standing here and ironing a shirt for me
and tells me afterwards
that I too am a grandfather. That goes without saying,
that I will be a grandfather and she a grandmother
and your mother a healthy grandmother.
She should be able to at least go for a walk with the baby carriage a few times.
Hey, the Lord God should help, we should already have good news
that will make our hearts lighter.
Now, with us,
it's not going badly.
They are beating the Arabs on all fronts.
But there are also many losses on our side.
Many young children
have gone to sleep
and older people have also gone to sleep.
I am very annoyed,
very annoyed I am,
because I am not very healthy
and this time I cannot take part
in all of it, except
for the money that we gave, we gave all
from the health insurance for one month, the whole month's
this wage that we earn,
we gave for one month, and besides that,
I gave more money.
Soldiers should be sent blankets.
One gives as much as one can.
Everyone gives, not just me.
Unfortunately,
this is all too little.
Well, thank God, dear George, you shouldn't worry, and not Ziva.
We don't need anything.
We have everything.
It's just, we only have one wish:
The Arabs should be fought,
they should know that this is no joke with Jews.
Our dear Moshe Dayan
is also on the front, just like all the soldiers.
He goes together with them all.
And we hope that under his hand they will all be broken,
like an old dish
and an old piece of wood.
With us, things are going very well on all fronts now.
With us,
every child and every oldest person works together.
We all schoolchildren, we work
in different places.
In the post office are all schoolchildren.
They sell different things at the...
Do you know what that thump was?
Your mother is ironing a shirt,
as usual, now everything falls from her hand.
The iron fell down.
And it clattered. Thank God.
