1: Dear George and Zira.
2: Today is a holiday.
3: And we are sitting together with mother and expecting at least a telegram from you
4: about what, with the help of the Lord God, has already been born.
5: But until now, we have nothing.
6: We are thinking, we are not sleeping.
7: Whole nights, not just one night, but we don't sleep at all.
8: Neither mother nor I.
9: But we hope to the Lord God that everything will go well
10: and you will be a healthy father and she [Ziva] a healthy mother.
11: Mother is standing here ironing a shirt for me and repeating after me that I too am a grandfather.
12: It goes without saying that I will be a grandfather and she a grandmother, and your mother a healthy grandmother.
13: She should be able, at least a few times, to go for a walk with the stroller.
14: Oh, the Lord God should help, we should already have good news.
15: so that our hearts become lighter.
16: Now, things are not going badly for us.
17: We are beating the Arabs on all fronts.
18: But there are also many losses on our side.
19: Many young children have gone to sleep [passed away], and older people have also gone to sleep [passed away].
20: I am very annoyed, very annoyed I am.
21: because I am not very healthy and this time I cannot take part in everything
22: except for the money we gave; we all gave one month's worth, a whole month's worth, from the health insurance
23: this, uh, uh, uh, uh, wage that we earn, we gave for one month, and besides that,
24: I also gave money...
25: ...soldiers, one should send blankets/covers.
26: One gives as much as one can.
27: Everyone gives, not just me.
28: Unfortunately, that is all too little.
29: Well, thank God, dear George, you shouldn't worry, and neither should Ziva.
30: We don't need anything at all, we have everything.
31: It's just, we only have one wish: The Arabs should be fought, they should know it's no joke [dealing] with Jews.
32: Our dear Moshe Dayan is also at the front, just like all the soldiers.
33: He goes together with all of them, and we hope that under his hand, they will all be shattered like old crockery.
34: And an old piece, piece of wood.
35: For us, things are going very well now on all fronts.
36: With us, every child and every older person collaborates/helps.
37: We all, schoolchildren, they work in various places.
38: In the post office are all schoolchildren.
39: They, they sell various things at...
40: Do you know what that [mishap/sound] was?
41: Your mother is ironing a shirt, as usual, now everything falls from her hand.
42: The iron fell down.
43: And it worked out. Thank God.
