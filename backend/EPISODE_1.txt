Episode 1: Waiting in the Shadow
[SOUND of a reel-to-reel tape recorder starting - whirring, clicking, then steady hiss]
NARRATOR: October 1973. The sounds of war echo across Israel. Sirens wail intermittently in the distance, planes occasionally streak overhead. But amidst the national crisis of the Yom Kippur War, personal lives, hopes, and anxieties continue. Imagine waiting for the joyous news of your first grandchild, but the phone lines are silent, mail is disrupted, and the air outside hums with the tension of conflict.
NARRATOR: In a small home, somewhere in Israel, a father picks up a microphone. His name is Shmuel. He’s recording a message on a reel-to-reel tape, a precious lifeline to his son George and daughter-in-law Sylvia, far away, likely in Australia. They are expecting their first child any day now.

SHMUEL (Audio Recording - German, translated):
(0:18) [Voice is weary but clear, tinged with deep anxiety]
Dear George and Sylvia,
Today is Friday. And we are sitting together with Mother, and waiting for a telegram from you, at least, about what, with the help of the Lord God, has already been born. But up to now, we have nothing.
[Sighs heavily]
We are thinking... we don't sleep... the whole nights, not just one night, but we don't sleep at all. Neither Mother nor I.
[Pause]
But we hope in the Lord God that everything will go well, and you will be a healthy father, and Sylvia a healthy mother.
(1:21) [Slight shift in tone, acknowledging the mother nearby]
Mother is standing here ironing a shirt for me and telling me to say that I am also a grandfather. That's understood, that I will be a grandfather and she a grandmother, and your mother [Sylvia’s mother] a healthy great-grandmother. She should at least be able to go for a walk with the stroller a few times.
(1:47) [Voice thickens with emotion]
Ay, the Lord God should help, we should already have good news, so that it will be easier on our hearts.
(1:58) [Tone shifts again, becoming more serious, reporting]
Now, here with us, things aren't going badly. They are beating the Arabs on all fronts, but there are also many losses among us. Many young children have gone to sleep [euphemism for died], and older people have also gone to sleep.
(2:26) [Frustration enters his voice]
I am very annoyed, very annoyed I am, because I am not very healthy, and this time I cannot take part in anything, except for the money that I gave. We gave, all of us, from the health insurance, one month, the whole month's... this... uh... wage that we earn, we gave one month. And besides that, I gave more money... for the soldiers, one should send packages… pastries. One gives as much as one can. Everyone gives, not just me.
(3:16) [Resignation, reassurance]
Unfortunately, that is all too little. Well, thank God, dear George, you shouldn't worry too much and neither should Sylvia. We need nothing at all. We have everything. It is... we have only one wish: the Arabs should be defeated. They should know that it's no joke with Jews.
(3:42) [Renewed determination, invoking leadership]
Our dear Moshe Dayan is also on the front, just like all the soldiers. He goes together with them all. And we hope that under his hand, they will all be broken, just like an old dish, and an old piece of wood.
NARRATOR: Shmuel’s voice carries the weight of sleepless nights, the constant see-saw between personal hope for his growing family and the stark realities of the war engulfing his nation. He feels helpless physically, but contributes what he can, sharing in the collective burden and the fierce desire for survival and victory. The tape continues to turn, capturing this intimate moment amidst the vast canvas of conflict.
[SOUND of tape hiss continues for a moment, then fades slightly under Narrator's closing words]
NARRATOR: His message is far from over. The tape recorder keeps rolling, a fragile thread connecting hearts across continents, waiting in the shadow of war.
[SOUND of tape hiss swells slightly then fades out]
