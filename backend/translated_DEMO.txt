English translation:

(0:18) [Male speaker 1, likely father/grandfather, speaking German]
Dear George and Sylvia,
Today is Friday. And we are sitting together with Mother, and waiting for a telegram from you, at least, about what, with the help of the Lord God, has already been born. But up to now, we have nothing. We are thinking... we don't sleep... the whole nights, not just one night, but we don't sleep at all. Neither Mother nor I.

But we hope in the Lord God that everything will go well, and you will be a healthy father, and Sylvia a healthy mother.

(1:21) Mother is standing here ironing a shirt for me and telling me to say that I am also a grandfather. That's understood, that I will be a grandfather and she a grandmother, and your mother a healthy great-grandmother. She should at least be able to go for a walk with the stroller a few times.

(1:47) Ay, the Lord God should help, we should already have good news, so that it will be easier on our hearts.

(1:58) Now, here with us, things aren't going badly. They are beating the Arabs on all fronts, but there are also many losses among us. Many young children have gone to sleep [euphemism for died], and older people have also gone to sleep.

(2:26) I am very annoyed, very annoyed I am, because I am not very healthy, and this time I cannot take part in anything, except for the money that I gave. We gave, all of us, from the health insurance, one month, the whole month's... this... uh... wage that we earn, we gave one month. And besides that, I gave more money... for the soldiers, one should send packages/pastries. One gives as much as one can. Everyone gives, not just me.

(3:16) Unfortunately, that is all too little. Well, thank God, dear George, you shouldn't worry too much ["übertrachten" - likely worry/think too hard] and neither should Sylvia. We need nothing at all. We have everything. It is... we have only one wish: the Arabs should be defeated. They should know that it's no joke with Jews.

(3:42) Our dear Moshe Dayan is also on the front, just like all the soldiers. He goes together with them all. And we hope that under his hand, they will all be broken, just like an old dish, and an old piece of wood.

(4:05) With us, it's going very well now on all fronts. With us, every child and every oldest person works along. The schoolchildren, they work... in various places.

(4:26) In the post office are all schoolchildren. They... they sell various things by... Oh! (4:34) [Loud crash/bang sound]

(4:42) ...Do you know what that bang was? Your mother was ironing a shirt. As usual, everything falls from her hand. The iron fell down... and klapped [made a noise/hit?]. Thank God. She finished it. And laughs... laughs like... like... uh... Lon Chaney, have you seen the film Lon Chaney? She laughs too, yes.

(5:13) Dear George... and Sylvia... Let's hope... that we will see each other... (5:29) [Music/different audio source briefly interrupts: "...never could get them down... Katie lies... you can see it in her eyes..."] Oh yes... (5:39) Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing 1, 2, 3.

(5:45) [Original speaker resumes] ...a lazy/careless ["leidigändiger"?] person. I've been working with her maybe 3 months already... I ask her, she should get a passport... until today she hasn't had pictures taken... Negligent. Like... like... like... who knows... she is negligent. And I already brought home all the questionnaires to fill out... and the questionnaires are also lying around... like crap ["bekackt"], understand?... And she does nothing about it. But this week I hope she will take the pictures... maybe... and she will make the passport.

(6:33) Dear George, I will do everything. The Lord God should just help... it should be good... and the war should end. I will do everything... I will borrow ["borgen"?] and make debts ["verschulden"?]... and I will send Mother there. Even with force ["mit Koach"], with strength I will send her. She must go. Because I can... another month, another month and a half I will work... and I will already be finished with work. I can stay alone... and she will travel. 100% she will come... to you.

(7:21) And maybe God will help, the Lord God help, then afterwards I will also come... if... your brother-in-law earns much money... and will... after Mother comes... buy me a ticket... I will hopefully also come.

(7:48) I ask you very much... you should all not think too hard. Hopefully... it will be good. I am waiting for no letter... because the post doesn't work... the planes don't come. I only wait for this tape... which Sylvia sent out once... these tapes we haven't received. Tell your brother-in-law... he should write... write much... and maybe something will come.

(8:36) Dear George, I wanted to record/dub ["überspielen"?] a bit... I wanted you all to hear the news in Hebrew. Sylvia will tell you everything.

(8:46) [Hebrew News Broadcast Segment Begins - Summary]
Good morning, happy holidays. It is 9:00. News from Ron Bartur. In recent nights, special naval forces conducted sabotage operations inside Egyptian naval bases. Israeli naval vessels shelled Egyptian coastal installations. An IDF spokesman announced that naval commandos penetrated the harbors of Port Said and Ras el-Adabiya, sabotaging enemy ships docked there. Heavy hits on designated targets were reported. Coastal installations and military targets were shelled overnight by naval vessels in the Port Said sector on the Mediterranean and in the Ras Za'afarana sector in the Gulf of Suez. Our ships returned safely to their bases at the conclusion of the operation.

Syrian planes bombed a Druze village in the Golan Heights yesterday afternoon, killing a 3-year-old girl and another person. The IDF spokesman reported that bombs fell inside the village of Majdal Shams. Besides the fatalities, 15 other people were injured. Overnight, several shells fell in two areas near the Syrian front – the Ramat Magshimim area and the Gdot area – but caused no injuries or property damage.

A resident of Shlomi was injured overnight when two Katyusha rockets were fired at the town from across the Lebanese border. The town's electricity network was also damaged. The IDF spokesman, reporting this morning, noted that there were additional terrorist actions during the night hours. Shells exploded in the Kfar Sold area and the Manara area, but no one was injured and no property was damaged. An IDF ambush killed two terrorists in the Metula area.

The International Red Cross announced last night that it received a limited first list of Israeli POWs from the Arabs. The list includes 37 POWs who surrendered at the Mezach outpost [Bar-Lev Line] in the southern Canal, and another six POWs whom Red Cross representatives visited in hospitals in Cairo. According to the International Red Cross spokesman, Arab countries promised to transfer additional lists and even allow Red Cross representatives to visit the POWs.

US Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger stated last night that the United States, while trying to ensure its own protection from war, does not do so at the expense of peace for other nations of the world. He said the efforts to end the conflict in the Middle East are a test of the true meaning of détente between the United States and the Soviet Union. The US is trying to find a solution to the grave situation through a combination of diplomacy and firmness. He believes it is possible to find a fair and just solution to the conflict, but first, the war must stop. The US Secretary of State was speaking before the Association of Military Personnel in the United States, which awarded him the George C. Marshall prize for the year 1973.

Our correspondent in Washington reports that President Nixon may invoke emergency powers to conserve fuel, following the decision by the Persian Gulf oil principalities to cut oil production. Senator Jackson, chairman of the Senate Interior Committee, proposed legislation on this matter overnight. The discussion particularly concerns limiting driving and flying speeds. And an announcement: Starting today, we will broadcast summaries and commentary on the situation three times a day, at 1:00 PM, 7:00 PM, and 11:00 PM. Reports from the margins of the news, as they become available, will be broadcast during odd-numbered hours. News bulletins will be broadcast every hour on the hour. This is the end of the news bulletin, and now for the reports.

(9:15) [Studio Introduction - Hebrew]
Good morning. This is Dan Patir in the joint studio of Israel Broadcasting and Galei Tzahal.

(9:22) [IDF Spokesman Report Summary - Hebrew]
An IDF spokesman announced this morning that quiet prevailed overnight along the Syrian and Canal fronts, although on the Syrian front, several shells fell in the Ramat Magshimim area and the Gdot area. There were no casualties and no damage to property. The IDF spokesman also reported this morning that Syrian planes bombed the Druze village of Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights yesterday afternoon. Several bombs fell inside the village. As a result, two people were killed, including a three-year-old girl, and 15 other people were injured.

(9:40) [Report from Northern Front - Dan Laor - Hebrew]
The northern front was quiet tonight, the eve of Simchat Torah. Since the fighting stopped in the central sector of the Golan Heights yesterday afternoon, relative calm prevails throughout the area. And I emphasize relative calm, because yesterday Syrian artillery was very active, and both our artillery and our planes were forced to silence it. But even in the absence of dynamic fighting on the ground, our soldiers continued to work hard during the past day. The artillery still demands a constant response. Holding the territory we captured requires high readiness and alertness. And the prolonged stay of forces in the field strains and complicates the operations of the various service systems. These, it seems, are the three main issues occupying the forces during the static warfare.

But these pressing issues do not, heaven forbid, push aside the preparations for the holiday. The commander of one of the formations in the area, who has been engaged in the work of war for 12 days, took the trouble last night to pull out a bottle of wine from his pack and offered me a glass while I was interviewing him about the situation. More substantial than this is the Chief Military Rabbi, Brigadier General Mordechai Piron, who went around visiting units on the Golan Heights last night and provided them with Torah scrolls. Tonight, the Rabbi plans to hold Hakafot [Simchat Torah circuits/dances] with many participants in one of the forwardmost units on the northern front, while in the rest of the positions, smaller Hakafot will be held. The Chief Military Rabbinate has already managed to deliver bottles of wine to the soldiers, and with the end of the day in the expanses of the Golan Heights, we will all drink L'chaim [To life!].

(10:30) [Report from Washington - Yaakov Ahimeir - Hebrew]
That was Dan Laor's report from the Syrian Golan Heights. The Washington Post continues this morning to publish details about American military aid to Israel, alongside reports about the continuation of the Soviet airlift to Egypt and Syria. Our correspondent in Washington, Yaakov Ahimeir, reports:
More details about the scope of US military aid to Israel are published this morning in the Washington Post newspaper. So far, dozens of modern American tanks have arrived in Israel by air. Along with this, the newspaper writes, at least three or four Israeli ships are docked in US and European waters, loading M60 tanks in significant quantities. These tanks will arrive in Israel within about two weeks. The Washington Post adds that a dozen C-130 transport planes that brought military equipment to Israel have been handed over to Israel for the duration of the war. So far, 25 Phantom jets have been sent to Israel, the newspaper writes, and it is possible that the pace of Phantom shipments will slow down. According to these sources cited by the Washington Post this morning, the pace of Skyhawk shipments to Israel is slower than that of the Phantoms. According to current plans, Israel will receive between 24 and 36 Skyhawks. The Washington Post reports this morning that Pentagon officials are now considering a report, which for the time being has no confirmation, that Soviet ships in Latakia have brought about 340 T-54 and T-62 tanks to Syria. Sources in the US Department of Defense say they have no doubt that Soviet ships are carrying tanks, docking in Syrian waters, but the question is how many tanks these ships brought and whether Syria can man the tanks. These are the doubts, but Pentagon officials say there are signs that the Soviet Union has increased its shipments of ammunition via air and sea to Syria and Egypt, and that tanks, and perhaps even planes, are arriving by sea. In any case, the traffic of Soviet ships through the Bosphorus straits is increasing, and Senator Henry Jackson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, yesterday raised the possibility that the Soviet ships are carrying not only equipment but also personnel. Senator Jackson said this in an interview he granted to CBS radio broadcasts. The Senator, who advocates taking a tough stance against the Soviet Union, believes that the Soviets will not intervene directly in the war as long as the United States gives them unequivocal signals regarding its position. That's all from Washington.

(11:37) [Report from London - Haggai Pinsker - Hebrew]
That was Yaakov Ahimeir's report. This morning we heard about possible steps the American administration might take to mitigate the negative impacts likely in the United States as a result of the decision by some Arab oil countries to cut production. President Nixon, who returned to Washington, is considering the possibility of imposing emergency powers to reduce fuel consumption. This issue also occupies the London newspapers this morning. Our correspondent there, Haggai Pinsker, reports:
The main headlines in this morning's British newspapers dedicate considerable space in their reports and articles to the Arab countries' decision to cut oil exports. Most of them emphasize the expected rise in oil prices and analyze the situation in light of Britain's efforts to heal its economy. The Financial Times notes that if the cut in oil supply continues, there will be a direct increase of 400 million pounds sterling in the balance of payments. Since Britain's balance is negative, the government will face serious problems in financing the deficit and in its anti-inflationary policy. The Telegraph also calls on the government to invest efforts in the rapid development of oil sources in the North Sea. The government will be guilty of criminal negligence if it does not encourage the exploitation of discoveries quickly. The Express asks to learn the lesson from dependence on Middle Eastern oil. This dependence is unacceptable. The newspaper calls for turning Britain from an oil-importing country to an oil-exporting country so that it can tell all the blackmailers: Go boil [literally: cook] in your oil. The Times examines Britain's interests in the Middle East. It lists them one by one and contrasts Britain's dependence on oil with its commercial interests in the region, in which Israel plays a vital role. The Times distinguishes between primary interests and secondary interests and concludes that all interests are endangered by the war. Therefore, Britain's main interest is in ending the war, if possible, by achieving a settlement. Haggai Pinsker, London.

(11:34) [Report from Israel Aerospace Industries - Hebrew]
And finally, a report from home. Like many factories in the economy, Israel Aerospace Industries organized within a short time and mobilized for the war effort. From the coordination center set up at the site, our correspondent Eli Nachmias interviews the Deputy Director General of Israel Aerospace Industries, Gabi Gidor.
Gidor: Mr. Gidor, what are you doing here? I understand this is your war room. Yes, this is our war room. From here, we coordinate the entire potential of Israel Aerospace Industries in terms of manpower, machinery, and activate all of this according to the guidelines, instructions, and priorities of the defense establishment.
Nachmias: Does IAI continue production or repairs for clients outside of Israel?
Gidor: Positively. We also continue, as far as possible, to supply our clients abroad, of course in those cases where it does not interfere with the war effort. And as an example, despite the war, we continue to supply parts for Westwind aircraft abroad.
Nachmias: Mr. Gidor, can you elaborate? What are the services you provide to the defense establishment – in missiles, electronics, in your various factories?
Gidor: One of our factories provides all the necessary support to the Navy, including, among other things, of course, the missiles manufactured by IAI, the Gabriel missiles. In addition to that, we help the Navy with various other systems, which perhaps the time has not yet come to talk about. In the same factory, we also deal with the repair of Hawk missiles. Another factory of ours deals with providing services and support to the Signal Corps, and we are one of the major suppliers for the IDF in communications equipment generally.
Nachmias: In the Phantom engine repair division, the division manager tells us:
Manager: This is a peak, in terms of speed of work. And we try to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible and with the quality as much as possible.
Nachmias: Among the many volunteers working here in the hangars of Israel Aerospace Industries, there is also a group of engineers from the Aeronautical Engineering Department at the Technion, who volunteered, mobilized for work here as simple mechanics. Yaakov Bracha, who is an aeronautical engineer for aeronautical research at the Technion, has been working here as a mechanic for several days. Yaakov, what exactly are you doing?
Bracha: I wasn't a mechanic before, but here I help the people who usually work in this department and they know the profession.
Nachmias: [End IAI report] Israel Aerospace Industries in a state of emergency. And with that, we conclude...

(11:58) [Original Speaker 1 resumes - German]
Yeah... Dear George... that was... the news. You should also all know... what is happening. I think that in Australia, on television, on the radio... you hear everything too... but I have a duty... you should all know what is happening here.

(12:24) Dear George and Sylvia... and the son... our... Stay all calm. It will be good. Another few days... but this will pass.

(12:48) It passes... in life, all bad things... good things come eventually. So it is with this too. The Arabs... will be beaten... like stones... on the street. And peace comes. Another few days... another few days. One can do nothing at all.

(13:16) Ending... for now... I think that the mother... will also... want to say a few words... because she thinks a lot... and she makes my life hard here too.

(13:34) And life... she makes life hard for me... because... she sits the whole day... and thinks things over. Sleep, she doesn't sleep... and I don't either. It's a bit hard... but... let's hope to the Lord God that it passes. I think that the mother comes... to say a few words.

(13:56) So the mother says... she will afterwards... gather everything in her head... say a few words. Dear children... All our acquaintances... send greetings... and kisses. Sylvia should be healthy... and recover well already with her thing [the birth]. It should be... a healthy child, doesn't matter what kind of child... girl or... a boy... but we should hear good news already.

(14:36) Otherwise... there is... unfortunately no news... letters we haven't had for a long time. And I ask you George, I already sent away... two tapes... but I haven't received them back. And I... have bought another... new one. And... tapes... are hard to get now... everyone buys them out... One buys everything out generally. But... it's also very expensive here. It costs... now... about $4. It's a bit... a bit too hard for me.

(15:21) You understand? So... always when I send a tape... they don't keep it long... and send it back. For me, I should have... in reserve... to send to you. Well, for now stay healthy... all of you. I greet and kiss... your mother [likely Sylvia's mother]... and greet/kiss Nani. Greet and kiss Sylvia... and... your brother-in-law.

(15:58) And ask him... when he writes... he should write the return address... from you [George]... and not from him [the brother-in-law]. So... for now it must be like this. The second page... he shouldn't write... his... return address... but he can write... return address from Sylvia... or return address from... uh... yours [George's]. It doesn't matter... but not his. It must not be yet... there's still time.

(16:36) Well... now... it's also not very good... better... not... should be the return address from you... or from Sylvia.

(16:50) [Wife prompts husband in background] Uh... dear George... the mother tells me... that I should... tell your brother-in-law... that we eat... every day... 'Tol Kol Yom Toachara' [unclear phrase, possibly family joke related to simple/repetitive food]. He knows already what that is... Toachara. We eat that every day. ...we are happy... what we have... and we are happy... what we have... every day... uh... in German they say the same crap... He said that... Kol Yom Toachara. We are happy that we have that... and... it shouldn't be missing... it should continue like this. But thank God... we lack nothing... and we have everything... what we need. Only the Lord God should give health... and we should be able to endure everything.

(17:51) Sometimes... we run... into the bunker. But your mother didn't want to run anymore. The... many people... ask the mother... where your son-in-law ["Schwager" can mean this too] is. Didn't want... Mother didn't want to go there... the people shouldn't ask... where... is... the son-in-law... of George.

(18:13) Well... she says... what... is destined... shall be... and she doesn't go out... from the house. By us it's dark now... every evening... it must be dark. And... one sleeps... in clothes. It's a bit hard... but... let's hope to the Lord God... that it passes.

(18:47) I think that the mother comes... to say a few words.

(18:56) [Wife speaks, German] So... the mother... now... runs... she... makes order... she washes the window... and... makes the floor clean... and she has no time to talk on the tape. So... she will be finished, she said... then she will gather everything in her head... and will... tell you everything... and will tell you everything... say everything.

(19:19) [Speaker 1 resumes, German] With Mother [Matilda?] at home, and wait for a letter... or news from you and from your children. We wanted to know everything, what is happening with you at home. We know very well that you are with us in heart, but we are also with our hearts together with you. I hope that the Lord God will help, that we will see each other in life, together rejoice with our little child, which should come, maybe it has already come into the world. And we will play together with it. Whatever it will be, either a girl or a boy. I believe, Ruthie, that you will also be a healthy, a good grandmother, and we will all be happy together. What will become of us, we unfortunately don't know yet, but we hope to the Lord God that everything will be good. For now, the Arabs receive blows ["Schleck"] on all fronts, and they strike as much as goes in there. But one cannot know what tomorrow will bring.

(20:19) [Wife interjects: You're philosophizing too much.] What? [He answers her:] I'm only telling you the truth. For now, they receive blows. And I think that we will defeat the Arabs. If the Lord God helps, and this comes to an end, we will see each other and we will tell everything verbally. Ruthie wishes you much luck and health. I greet you and kiss you. Greet the Nani and all good acquaintances. Stay healthy, all of you, together with the children. Goodbye, Shmuel.

(20:59) [Wife/Mother speaks, Polish]
My dear children, actually I should speak English so all three of you understand, but I don't have the possibility, nor the strength to speak German. So at the end I will say a few words to George, and now I will speak to you in Polish. It's probably been 12 days since our cruel war began. Today is the holiday, the last day of the holiday, I forgot what it's called... Simchat Torah. And the children opposite already took down the Sukkah that was built. It's Thursday. Our days pass as if normally, one could say, only from time to time planes fly over. The day until 5 o'clock is no different from a day of ordinary life without war. That is, Dad and I go to work, we go together. Dad takes me now to Herzliya because my leg is a bit heavy [difficult?], so from Herzliya I go to Raanana. In Raanana I stay a few hours, then I come home and Dad comes home. Usually, we eat dinner together. But the hardest is the period from 5 o'clock, when it's dark. I can't get used to the atmosphere of this terrible darkness. Because on one hand, all the times of past years flash before me, and on the other hand, it's connected with helplessness, and I can't sit and do nothing. I sit in the armchair and watch television, listen to the radio. I don't turn off... we don't turn off the radio at all. But Dad promised me that he will cover the windows in my... where my bunk stands, and I will be able to write and read in the evenings. Because like this, it's hard for me. I don't have time to read the newspaper in its entirety because I try to do everything by 5 o'clock, so that dinner is ready. I don't really have anything to do anyway. The wardrobe is tidy, there's nothing to tidy, everything is clean and... today I tidied up the kitchen a bit. I try as best I can to be busy, because my nerves are getting to me. And our nights are sleepless.
I have to calm down a bit and then I'll talk to you. I want to say, George, that just now there was a phone call. I am happy from Israel [meaning, call from Israel?] that he came from the front for a few hours and... home, overnight he will be home, and tomorrow they are taking him from the front, he will be closer. We were at Hanele's. Hanele's wedding will take place next week, if God grants we live to see it, in Blinder [place name?], in the... in the Rabbinate. And from... from Rajski I also have news, from Roma I have news too, so thank God, her husband called from the front... her daughter's, I forgot her name. Now... what else... Nu, and Wikta called me today, I'm waiting for a call too, maybe Pinhas will give some sign of life. And so I think, I am only with you [in thought], whether you are already after the resolution [birth?], if everything is well, because we want to see you healthy and whole. I have to calm down, take a 5-minute break. I interrupted the first time since the war broke out, I tell you the truth. I am so hardened and petrified that even all those cries that... that I experience when I am in Shikun Peres [neighborhood name], when they come to notify, I couldn't cry. Only now, the first time after this call from Israel, I was so relieved. She suspects, Zosia [addressing someone else?], what they notify about. The gentlemen come, two of them, with a doctor and a rabbi. Nu, and what... what can I tell you, Zosiu? I would very much like to know what is happening with you. With us, it's such nice weather. The sun is shining now. We were early today at Tosia's, at Leon's. We listen to the radio. We ate dinner. We went to sleep. Night comes again. We sit and talk with Dad. We don't sleep at all. We don't know what sleep means. I wrote you several letters from the moment the war broke out. We don't have any... any news. The only thing, I tell you, Kuba called from Canada, it moved us so heartily. My cousin called from Los Angeles, who really has such a heartfelt contact, calls me... from Haifa, Cyla, Neboshtik's [the late] Cwi's wife. Nu, what can I tell you? Josik gave news that he is alive and... and was at home... at the... at that stepmother's... uh... told me... Cyla, that... that Josik wrote you a letter. When you receive the letter, reply immediately, because now, if... if the mail is running by you already... if you don't have a strike, then every day, every day write a few words, so that every second or third day, either you or your brother, send a letter. Because it is so necessary now.
Now ask George, if you can't write, for us his every word is sun, is light. I don't know, this war is completely different from that war that was in '39, which we lived through. I was young, I was on the Russian front and worked and ran between bullets, and no bullet reached me. Then was the second war, the six-day one, I had you with me. And now we raised two children and the children are far from us. And it... on one hand, we rejoice and are happy and cry from happiness, but on the other hand, we ask God to allow this all to end well, so that we can meet again and that all this will be for us like a bad dream that passes, and that we will laugh at these letters I've already written to you and this... this tape... the one we recorded.

(21:55) [Wife/Mother speaks, German]
Give me now a few words, I'll say to Michas [Michael?], Zosiu. My dear son Michael, my only dear son, who is so far from us. My question is one: if you spoke with, met someone from our country [Israel]? I want to know everything. That... I think that Rosenbaum's son shouldn't meet now. If... if... if you meet him, tell him that they asked me [or: he was asked?] not to do any... mischief/trouble ["kissof"?]. [Interruption]... In that moment I interrupted because there was a phone call, we got a call from the post office that a tape came from you... Telegram... and that... but... that you got the tape. I am overjoyed. Zosiu... that means I am calm now, a bit calmer. And... and once more... ah, I interrupted the conversation with your brother. So I want to continue talking. From Paam [place/person?] and Ikarati [person?] how happy I am that you are there, but I tell you once more, what I spoke at the beginning, that it's better not to see. This way... they asked me to convey to Rosenbaum that he shouldn't meet with the sons of our country. Uh... if you... how do you feel? What are you doing? I would like to know everything, but we know nothing. About the continuation of your development, in... in work, in life together with your... sister and brother-in-law. How much we want to know. You wrote a telegram asking if we need anything. There's no need for such questions. I am surprised that you allowed such questions to be sent. We don't need... our fridge is full. Every time I tell Dad, every day we eat 'oto chara' [that same thing/crap?]. But we are happy that we eat 'oto chara'. Uh... it should be that we always have the same thing. We have meat, we have steaks, we have chicken, and we have butter, and we have cheese, and yellow cheese, and milk, everything is there. Only the telegram that Ziva already finished her suffering [birth], we want to know. Uh... Sherli, Ziva's friend from Afula, I just wanted to know if she knows anything. I ask you very much, my son, that you write about this. Much. Write about this. You understand... uh... about whom I mean. I think so, that I am quite clear saying... I... we don't... write... about the relatives at all. Just with you. I... we don't... Write about your company, about your... about everything what is. We don't need, thank God, anything, nothing. We have... Only we want that quiet... mental quiet... that nothing should happen to our dearest, youngest children... and that... that we should receive good letters from you. Tell Ruthie thank you. Tell... greet Sabta, the mother, the general [referring to Sabta?], hopefully we will meet her. The little Peter, his little sister, the... the mother of the little children [referring to Ruthie?], your friends, Goren family, everyone who cares about us, certainly, who want to know about us. Today is Thursday, the time is 3:00, and we sit and wait for... for news, only good news, hopefully. What else to tell you? Uh... if you wrote a letter to Paula, that also I want to know. We received a very nice letter from Włodek's mother. Włodek works there, and Dad works. What else to write to you? Sylvia and Szymon are in place. Chaim calls... Chaim and the children...
