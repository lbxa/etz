Dear George and Siva.
Today is a holiday
and we are sitting together
with mother
and expect from you
at least a telegram
about what has already
with the help of the Lord God, been born.
But so far we have nothing.
We are thinking,
We don't sleep
the whole nights, not just one night, but we don't sleep at all.
Neither mother nor I.
But we hope to the Lord God
that everything will go well
and you will be a healthy father
and Siva a healthy mother.
Mother is standing here and ironing a shirt for me
and tells me
that I too am a grandfather. That goes without saying,
that I will be a grandfather
and she a grandmother
and your mother a healthy grandmother.
She should be able, at least a few times, to go for a walk with the stroller.
Oh, the Lord God should help, we should already have good news,
so that our hearts become lighter.
Now with us
it's not going badly.
They are beating the Arabs on all fronts,
but there are also many losses among us.
Many young children
have gone to sleep [died]
and older people have also gone to sleep [died].
I am very annoyed,
very annoyed I am,
because I am not very healthy
and this time
I cannot take part in all of it,
except for the money
that I have given, we have all given
one month's pay from the health insurance,
the whole month,
this uh uh wage that we earn,
we have given one month and besides that
I have also given money.
Soldiers, one should send blankets.
One gives as much as one can.
Everyone gives, not just me.
Unfortunately, that is all too little.
Well, thank God, dear George, you shouldn't worry, and neither should Siva.
We don't need anything at all.
We have everything.
It is, we only have one wish:
The Arabs should be fought.
They should know, this is no joke with Jews.
Our dear Moshe Dayan
is also on the front,
just like all the soldiers.
He goes together with them all
and we hope that under his hand
they will all be broken,
like an old dish
and an old piece of wood.
With us, things are going very well now on all fronts.
With us, every child and every oldest person works along.
We all schoolchildren, we work
in different places.
In the post office are all schoolchildren.
They, they sell various things at...
Do you know what that bump was?
Your mother was ironing a shirt,
as usual, now everything falls from her hand.
The iron fell down
and it clattered. Thank God.

Keep on.
I never could get them down.
Hey, he lies.
You can see it in her eyes.
Oh yes.
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing, one, two, three.
